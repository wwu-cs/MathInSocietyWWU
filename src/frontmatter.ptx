		<title>Land Acknowledgement</title>
		<p>
			We acknowledge that the United States was created on stolen land. Portland, Oregon is on
			land where the Multnomah, Kathlamet, and Clackamas bands of the Chinook, Tualatin,
			Kalapuya, Molalla and many other Tribes made their homes along the Columbia River.
			Multnomah is a band of Chinooks that lived in this area.
		</p>
		<p>
			We thank the descendants of these tribes for being the original stewards and protectors
			of these lands since time immemorial. We also acknowledge that Portland, OR has one of
			the largest Urban Native American populations in the U.S. with over 380 federally
			recognized tribes represented in the Urban Portland Metropolitan area. We also
			acknowledge the systemic policies of genocide, relocation, and assimilation that still
			impact many Indigenous/Native American families today.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are honored by the collective work of many Native Nations, leaders and families who
			are demonstrating resilience, resistance, revitalization, healing and creativity. We are
			honored to be guests upon these lands. Thank you, and thanks also to our colleagues at
			the Portland State University Indigenous Nations Studies Program for crafting this
			acknowledgement.

			<title>Antiracist and Culturally Responsive Elements</title>
			<p>
				Our goal is for our students to see themselves in this book. We have added stories
				of mathematicians and economists with identities that have traditionally been
				underrepresented in textbooks. We use local places and culturally diverse names in
				the examples and exercises. We have examples with they/them/their pronouns and
				same-sex couples.
			</p>
   			<p>
   				In the democracy chapter we have included the Native American genocide and slavery
				which are often left out of math texts. We have also emphasized the names of civil
				rights leaders and African Americans killed by the police in our examples. We
				recognize there is more to do in this area and welcome contributions and feedback.

				Our goal is for the content of this book to be relevant and accessible to our

				the technology is doing. We emphasize readily available spreadsheets and GeoGebra,

		<title>Introduction to this Book</title>
		<p>
			Many important decisions in life can be made more effectively using quantitative
			information and logic. The goal of this book and course is for you to feel more
			comfortable and confident with mathematical tools that are applicable to your life now and in the future. We will work with proportions for scaling, rates for comparing quantities, and financial tools for managing money and taxes. We will learn about statistics for decisions that involve data, probability for decisions with uncertain events, and methods for fair group decision-making like apportionment and voting systems. By practicing with these methods, we hope you'll feel more empowered to use math to help you make the best decisions for yourself in college and beyond.
